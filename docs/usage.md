## Installation

To use cScript, you'll need a compatible interpreter for the language. The interpreter may be available as a standalone executable or as a library to integrate into your project.

## Running cScript Code

Once you have the cScript interpreter installed, you can run cScript code in one of the following ways:

- **Command Line**: Use the command-line interface to execute cScript files.

  ```bash
  cscript your_file.cs
  ```

- **Integrate into Projects**: If you're using cScript as part of a larger project, integrate the interpreter into your code to execute cScript snippets programmatically.

## Variables and Data Types

cScript supports variables and various data types:

- **Numbers**: Use integers or floating-point numbers to represent numeric data.

  ```cscript
  let count = 10;
  let price = 19.99;
  ```

- **Strings**: Represent text data using double or single quotes.

  ```cscript
  let message = "Hello, cScript!";
  let title = 'My Program';
  ```

## Statements

### Variable Declaration

Use the `let` keyword to declare variables. You can also provide an initial value during declaration.

Syntax:

```cscript
let variableName = initialValue;
```

Example:

```cscript
let x = 42;
let message = "Hello, World!";
```

### Print Statement

To display values to the console, use the `print` statement.

Syntax:

```cscript
print(expression);
```

Example:

```cscript
let message = "Hello, cScript!";
print(message);
```

## Examples

For more in-depth examples and practical use cases, refer to the examples provided in the [Examples](../docs/examples.md) section of the documentation.

That's it! You now have a basic understanding of how to use cScript. Explore further to discover more advanced language features and capabilities.
