## Hello, World!

The classic "Hello, World!" program in cScript.

```cscript
print("Hello, World!");
```

## Variable Declaration

Declare a variable and print its value.

```cscript
let x = 42;
print(x); // Output: 42
```

## Basic Arithmetic

Perform arithmetic operations using cScript.

```cscript
let a = 10;
let b = 5;
let sum = a + b;
let product = a * b;
print(sum); // Output: 15
print(product); // Output: 50
```

## Conditional Statements

Use conditional statements to control program flow.

```cscript
let temperature = 30;
if (temperature > 25) {
  print("It's hot outside!");
} else {
  print("It's not so hot.");
}
```

## Loops

Demonstrate looping with a "for" loop.

```cscript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i = i + 1) {
  print(i);
}
```

These examples provide a basic understanding of cScript's syntax and how to perform common programming tasks. You can explore more advanced language features and use these examples as a foundation for your own scripts and programs.
